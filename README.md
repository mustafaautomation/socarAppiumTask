# Socar Appium Automation Sample Task

In this task, I have tried to automate 2-3 cases using Appium by implementing the Page Object Model

I have not done much work in Appium / Selenium for quite some time and primarily my work was focused on Javascript-based automation tools like Cypress, Testcafe, Puppeteer, Jest, Supertest, and playwright.

Since Trevo.guard form submission was having issues so I chose to work on Appium for the mobile task.



## Installation Process

1. Clone the repository through git.

2. Synchronize the Maven POM.xml file

3. Connect the Android device

4. Add Platform version on the configuration file

5. Start Appium Server

6. Run testng.xml file to start execution of cases
